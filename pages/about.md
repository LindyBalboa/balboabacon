Hi, my name is Conner and this is my website. 
The first question you might have is "what's up with the name?".
Well the answer is simple, I love [Balboa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balboa_(dance)) and who doesn't love bacon? 
I originally planned to only use the domain for personal stuff and thought it was funny.
Now moving to use it publicly, I still like it so it is here to stay.

I'm an Ohio (USA) native born and raised. 
I did my undergrad in physics there as well-- I never really made it into the big world.
Then I decided to head off to Germany for graduate school, studying for a master's in [organic electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_electronics).
I'm currently working on finishing my thesis which involves improving a calibration method for [atomic force microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy).

When I'm not in the lab or crunching mountains of data, I enjoy dancing, rock climbing, reading, coding, playing with electronics, and cooking everything from tooth-rotting sweets to sweat-inducing chili.
My wonderful girlfriend supports me in many of those endeavors and she is just straight up awesome.
We make a great team, especially in the kitchen.

I decided I have things to say about the above topics and more, so I set up this little site where I can dump out my ideas.
This is still very much a work in progress, so don't be surprised if things shift around a lot.

Thanks for visiting!
